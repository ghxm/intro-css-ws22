# Before we begin: Advent of Code

[**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of computer programming challenges that have a Christmas-themed Advent calendar format.

&rarr; It's great for learning a new programming language!

Try it out if you like. Feel free to ask for help!

Derek Sollberger has created [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6bYLyUW4Vo) of how to solve the 2022 Advent of code in R.

**Consequences of networks** &rarr; independent variable

*Example*

- How the position of an actor in a network shapes the actor's power 
- How a characteristic of a network influences actor behavior within the network

\pause

**Prediciton of network characteristics** &rarr; dependent variable

*Example*

- How actor preferences influence the actor's position in the network
- How one type of connection in a network (e.g. business ties) can influence the emergence of another type of connection (e.g. friendship)




# Example {.c}

<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-PF1PyQ8PA -->


**Six degrees of separation**

refers to the the separation of people by social connections (e.g. friends of friends).

It can be shown that in a random network of friendships between 6 billion people, two people are on average separated by roughly 6 'chained' friendships.

- social relationships (e.g. friendship, kinship)
- interactions (e.g. sending and receiving messages, sharing resources)
- flows (spread of, e.g. ideas, diseases) &rarr; between nodes connected by relation or interaction ties

\pause

**Scope**

- Local networks (convenience samples)
- Complete / global networks


\pause

Complete networks are often unobtainable &rarr; *Sampling*

- Respondent-driven sampling &rarr; gain insights in network of hidden populations
- Network scale-up method &rarr; estimate the size hidden populations




# Boundary specification {.c}


**Boundary specification problem** "*In social networks boundaries can often logically extend to every human on the planet.*" [@light_introduction_2021-1]

\vspace{1em}

&rarr; Researchers need to specify the boundaries of the network they want to analyze






# How can we collect netowrk data? [@adams_strategies_2021]



**Collection via**

*Primary sources*

- Survey / Interviews

*Secondary sources*

- Information on individuals (e.g. archival sources)

*Hybrid sources*

- Sensor data / digital trace data / metadata

\vspace{0.5em}

+ text-corpora &rarr; Text networks




# Surveys / Interviews i

In surveys / interviews, we can ask respondents about their connections and relations to other entities. We can

- ask *open* or *closed* format questions \pause
- ask whether or not a relation exists \pause
- ask about the strength of relations \pause

# Surveys / Interviews ii


**Name generators**

- Example: "*Who do you contact if you get stuck with your work?*" \pause
- General Social Survey: "*From time to time, most people discuss important matters with other people. Looking back over the last six months, who are the people with whom you discussed matters important to you?*" &rarr; can be used to identify alters of an ego

\pause

&rarr; The exact name generator is determined by the research question



# Surveys / Interviews iii [@adams_strategies_2021]

**Name interpreters**

Ask additional questions on alters:

- attributes of the nominated alters
- details of the relationship
- strength or frequency of relationship



# Digital trace data / metadata {.c}

**Information on networks from**

- Monitoring of behavior (e.g. sensor data, app use log)
- Digital trace data (e.g. interaction on social media)
- Metadata (e.g. who cites whom, who follows whom)




# Ethics [@adams_strategies_2021]

**Data collection**

- Anonymity / Confidentiality &rarr; Problem: anonymized data can be used to deduct identities
- Informed consent
- Active consent / opt-out in population studies

\pause

**Centrality** refers to the 'importance' or 'advantage' of the position of a node in a network.

There are multiple ways to define and approach centrality and, hence, different measures of centrality, e.g.

- *Degree centrality*
- *Betweenness centrality*
- *Closeness centrality*
- Eigenvector centrality
- PageRank

**Social Origins of Dictatorships: Elite Networks and Political Transitions in Haiti**

How do social networks influence the organization of resistance to democracy?

**Theory**

- Social networks within groups of elites important for coordinating activities or spreading information
- Network position of individuals create variation in the amount of influence individuals can exert over others 
- The higher the centrality of an actor, the higher the incentive for a coup

**Network**

- Network of individuals based on firm-level data, business ownership data, and genealogical data
- Measure: Network centrality of individuals

**Results**

The higher the centrality, the more likely to participate in Coup attempts

**Blood is Thicker Than Water: Elite Kinship Networks and State Building in Imperial China**

Under which conditions are kinship-based institutions compatible with state building?

**Theory**

- Geographically dispersed kinship networks cross-cut local cleavages and incentivize elites to unite in pursuit of national, rather than sectarian, goals
- Elites embedded in such dispersed networks can benefit from a strong central state, which generates scale economies in providing protection and justice throughout a large territory

**Network**

- (Geographic) politician kinship network based on tomb epitaphs from 11th century China
- Measure: Concentration of the network

**Results**

The lower concentration (more dispersed) a network, the higher support for state building
