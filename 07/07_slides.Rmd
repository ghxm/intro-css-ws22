Make use of the office hours to receive feedback and get help if you get stuck with your paper! This can include but is not limited to 

- coding problems
- research design questions
- theoretical questions
- methodological questions
- presentation of your results

\vspace{0.2em}

&rarr; *Write us an e-mail describing your problem / general topic of inquiry and we will schedule an in-person meeting / Zoom call or, depending on the issue, handle your problem via e-mail.*


# Finding a topic for your paper

\smaller


**Sources of inspiration**

- interest in a particular technique
- interest in a particular substantive topic
- existing research papers (&rarr; use Google scholar and tools like elicit.org)
- @TODO



**Possible ways of interacting with existing research**

- replicate an approach in another context
- how can an existing argument be tested using CSS data / techniques?
- apply new techniques to existing data (&rarr; take look at data repositories like [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/))
- @TODO

\section{Research design basics}



# Types of research in CSS

\smaller
\smaller


**Exploratory:** Collecting 5000 newspaper articles from the New York Times to get an idea of how long it takes to collect them, what we can infer from the texts (topics? number of authors? positioning?)


**Descriptive:**

\vspace{-0.8em}

- Collecting all newspaper articles (e.g. from the Politics section) from the NYT and summarize how many are published per quarter on average, what the most written about topic is by year
- Evaluating the responses to a vote intention survey by household income or education to get an overview of how voting preferences are distributed among the respondents


**Confirmatory:**

\vspace{-0.8em}


- Use data on all NYT Politics articles to test your hypothesis about a bias in political reporting during election time
- Test what characteristics make people more likely to vote for the ruling party


**Predictive:** Use the reading / comment / click statistics of NYT articles to recommend articles to readers that they might also find interesting



# Types of analyses in Political Science {.c}

&rarr; When working with newly obtained or unstructured data, it is often helpful to engage in descriptive and exploratory analysis first to get a feel for the data and the ways in which you might be able to use them

&rarr; Most Political Science research is focused on confirmatory analysis; however *good exploratory and descriptive analysis* is often helpful in making data accessible and generating ideas for yourself and other researchers!

&rarr; *Data collection or methodolgical application efforts* are just as important as explanatory research



# What to include

@TODO
Describe in detail how you plan to

- obtain data
- analyze the data
- operationalize your variables of interest

It is also advisable to outline the advantages and disadvantages your approach might have compared to others.



# 

\section{CSS workflows: Best practices \& possibilities}


# Overview

In CSS and research, there a range of tools an techniques that can help us simplify and standardize certain processes, this includes

- writing **reproducible code** so that your analysis can be replicated by others (see also session #02)
- writing **markup languages** to write your paper in an easily reproducible and interactive documents
- using **literature management** software to keep track of your literature and citations
- using **version control** to track changes to your code
- using servers for resource intense **computation**





# Reproducbility: core principles [@p_ball_task_2016; @p_ball_principled_2016; @uwe_engel_reproducbility_2022]

1. **Transparency:** Analysis parts are complete and sufficiently documents
2. **Auditability:** Analysis can be executed by other researchers or on different platforms
3. **Reproducbility:** Results are the same for anyone running the analysis using the same code and data
4. *Scalability*: Code can handle other inputs and outputs than those used in the specific project



# Reproducibility: What does this mean for us? {.allowframebreaks}

\smaller

***Share your full code and data +***

\smaller


**&rarr; Transparency**

\vspace{-1em}

- write and store code in a way that is easily understandable for others (within reason)
- include all parts of code (incl. for figures, tables)
- document files, code and your data collection process

**&rarr; Auditability**

\vspace{-1em}


- include every step of the process (package dependencies, environment settings) in your code
- make sure the analysis can be run in a newly set up environment

**&rarr; Reproducibility**

\vspace{-0.8em}

taking **transparency** and **auditability** into account, make sure your results remain stable when re-running your analysis

**&rarr; Scalability** (within reason and your own ability)

\vspace{-1.5em}

try to write generalized rather than highly specific code



# Reproducible & interactive documents {.allowframebreaks}

\smaller

Markup languages separate text and formatting. This way you can write your paper without constantly worrying what it will look like. Popular choices in research include

- \LaTeX{}  &rarr; [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
- `pandoc` / Rmarkdown (&rarr; check out the lab files ending in `.Rmd` from our sessions)

While markup languages have many advantages (e.g. figure and table numbering / referencing, easy and consistent citing and much more), they also require some time to get used to and have a bit of a learning curve. *However, it can be useful to get now to be prepared for later challenges (e.g. your Bachelor thesis).*

There are many resources to get you started and Google and StackOverflow are your friend!

Fun fact: These slides are written in Markdown and typeset in \LaTeX{} using `pandoc` / Rmarkdown.



# Literature management

\smaller

Keep track of the literature you need for your research using literature management software. It can help you

- organize and sort through the literature you have saved
- save papers straight from your browser
- easily cite research in your own paper using various citation styles

Popular software includes

- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (free & open source!)
- [EndNote](https://endnote.com/)

Wikipedia also has a large [list of reference mangement software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software).


# Version control using `git` and GitHub {.shrink}

\smaller

**`git`**

-   Version control system (VCS): a system used to manage and track changes to your documents
-   allows for easy collaboration on coding projects

\vspace{-0.2em}


It may take some time to work with a VCS, but there are [`git` quickstart tutorial](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)s on the internet to help you ease in.

**GitHub**

-   an online version of `git`
-   you can easily make your projects public
-   and invite others to contribute to your project

\vspace{-0.2em}

As a student, you can [set up a free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) with all the features of a pro account!



# Computation

**Problem**

Computational analysis or data collection often takes time and resources &rarr; can render your computer unusable for a couple hours/days/weeks

**Solution**

@TODO servers etc





# Next session

\vspace{2em}

**Next session** 06 Feb 2023: Presentation of your term paper idea


&rarr; Don't hesitate to make use of the office hours before and after the session!
