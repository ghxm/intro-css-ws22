# Introduction to Computational Social Science - Syllabus

**Instructors**

## Course overview

This is the repository for the course 'Introduction to Computational Social Science' held at LMU Munich, Winter term 2022-23. The course is held in double sessions (2 x 90 minutes) every other week. Session are structured as follows: The first part of a session will include a presentation of the session's topic by the lecturers to set the theoretical foundation. In the second part of the sessions, students will be able to explore the topic themselves using structured coding exercises. The material provided will be written in the `R` programming language. While students are encouraged to engage with the provided `R` material, they can also choose to follow the course in a programming language they are familiar with.


### Abstract

The course 'Introduction to Computational Social Science' provides a first glimpse into the field of computational social science (CSS) for political scientists. The advent of computational techniques has opened a window to the use of large-scale data collection and analysis. Examples of CSS in political science include the automated collection and analysis of legal texts, parliamentary speeches, and social data employing web scraping, machine learning, simulation, and network analysis techniques.

We will introduce participants to the necessary context and tools to apply CSS concepts to their own research. Thus, the focus is twofold; First, the course will give an impression of the relevant conceptual and theoretical developments in the field. Second, we will engage in hands-on coding sessions to enable students to apply the presented concepts and techniques.

Participants of the course are welcome to develop and work on their own research projects employing CSS methods in the course. Basic prior knowledge of quantitative data analysis and/or programming is a plus but not required.


### Course requirements

TBA



### Additional information

At the end of some session's coding exercise you will find additional exercises and homeworks for yourself to try out and engage further with the material. These exercises are completely voluntary. If you decide to do them, you can hand them in to the lecturers to receive comments and feedback.

In accordance with the study regulations, attendance is not mandatory. However, since many of the course's theoretical and practical materials build upon each other, it is highly recommended to attend all of the session and to self-study session materials for sessions you might have missed.

If you cannot attend a session, please inform one of the lecturers beforehand. This helps us plan the session accordingly.


### Office hours

Students are encouraged to visit the instructors' office hours for help with understanding the theoretical and practical course materials.


**Offline**

If possible, please write an e-mail beforehand if you plan to attend the office hours to allow for better scheduling.
